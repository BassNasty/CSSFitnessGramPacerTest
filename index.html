      The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test, also known as the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER), is a multistage aerobic capacity test designed to measure a student's aerobic fitness.
 It involves running back and forth over a 20-meter distance at a pace dictated by audio cues, with the speed increasing progressively each minute until the participant can no longer keep up.

      The test begins with a 30-second countdown, and participants must complete each lap before the beep sound; the test ends when a participant fails to complete two laps in succession.
 Originally developed by Leger et al. in 1988 as a modification of an earlier adult test, it has become a widely used tool in physical education programs to promote lifelong health and personal progress rather than competition.
